An easy to use json based I/O database for C#

# How it works
Instead of having to bother yourself with SQL and add unnecessary dependencies to your project, you can use EzDatabase to make a simple file based database and store your info
in simple JSON format, or even store images, or anything you can normally store in your computer as a file!

It utitlizes Newtonsoft.Json to serialize and deserailize objects and then store them in .json format

To create some other type of file, you can simply specify the name and extension and store a string, byte array or stream inside
